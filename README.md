# game-picker
snippet for choosing games (or whatever you want) randomly;

game-picker-simple is a very short snipper, and picks one title randomly, only once, then prints it on the console;

game-chooser-better is a bit longer, randomly pushes multiple entries from the parameters into an array, which is then worked into an object in order to count what entry appears the most (Mathematical Mode);

dinner-picker is a gag code I made for a friend, whose girlfriend could never pick what she wanted to eat;

working on DOM integration sometime this month;

huge thanks to ChrisWFlannery at Twitter/X (AKA Code Tour on YouTube) for the tutorial on Mathematical Mode!
